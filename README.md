## Process:
- Identify data sources (Excel, SQL Server, etc.)

- Clean and transform data using Power Query (remove duplicates, handle missing values).

- Made sure data is consistent and standardized with respect to data types, data formats and values used.

- Optimize using DAX measures and calculated columns.

- Choose the right visualizations (e.g., bar chart, pie charts, maps, matrix, cards
